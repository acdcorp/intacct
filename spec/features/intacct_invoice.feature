Feature: Intacct Invoice
  I need to be able to send and receive Intacct Invoices.
  We need to also pass an invoice, customer and vendor when creating the object.

  Background:
    Given I have setup the correct settings
    And I have an invoice, customer and vendor
    Then I create an Intacct Invoice object

  Scenario Outline: It should "CRUD" an invoice in Intacct
    Given I use the #<method> method
    Then I should recieve a sucessfull response

    Examples:
      | method    |
      | create    |
      | delete    |
      | get_list  |
